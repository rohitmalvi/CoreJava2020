Batch processing
usecases->Banking, Education, HealthCare,
How batch processing working
how batch programming is works
source and target->reading data file to database and database to file 
                   writing data file to database and database to file

Advantages/feature
developers can concentrate on implementaion.
deuoupling between different layers is easy.
provides seperation between infrastructure and application..
Over 17 itemReader and 15 itemWriter implementition covering vast options for input and output..
The ability to stop/start/restart jobs and maintain state between excutions.
The ability to skip and retry records as they are being processed.
java or xml based configuration.
All the sring features like DI, AOP, Testability, etc....

Architectuure of Spring Batch
JOB-> job is a like i want to read file or write file anyting you have to tell so we have to configure someting.
STEPS-> reader->processor->writer
JOBLAUNCHER->after creating a job it is start that job
JOBREPOSITORY->in spring batch everyting as a Object, so everyobject associated with that jobRepository
Deom1. Reading the file, processing it and storing into database
in main class we have to enable batch processing by using @EnableBatchProcessing
we have a job we are telling to builder to create that job it is creating job object for you.demo1 is the name of job
we have a steop which is associated with the job object .and start we are passing a step name
Step is a combination reader processor writer for createing a job we have jobBuilder factory for creating a 
step we needed stepbuilder factory class in this process we are using flateFileInputReader.
we have a reader which is reading a data throw employee.csv file.
in FlateFileItemReader we are reading data as string formate and converting into a DTO.
then that EmployeeDTO object we will get
how mapping happening String to EmployeeDTO we have to tell this is the mapper inside setFieldSetMapper(new EmployeeFileRowMapper());
we have a mapper which is reading data and map into the object
@StepScope> provided by spring batch framework it means that all object you are created that object scope is in that step only.
job will having a multiple steps.
we are setting a line mapper-> we are defining what type of mapping we are going to use, colom type , colum name
setLineTokenizer is having some delemeter like(, or ||).in , it is optioonal else we have to define.
in employee we have a five column by using that coloum mapping is deine
we have fieldSet in row mapper which is hold all the value which is comming input file in the form of fieldSet Object.
processor
after reading the data you have to do someting into a data reading the dto and tronaforming the another dto
